## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid layout
- Media queries


### What I learned

Simple as it may seem, coding it was not funny. As a newbie, making my web pages responsive to different screen sizes is a daunting task for me. Going through this project has made me learn some intricacies pertaining using media query like "what not" and "what ought". 

### Continued development

Media query is still an area I still do need to make better concerning html and css. Not the best, I can more better.


### Useful resources
A lot of resources was helpful not just in this project but from the beginning of my learning of web development.

- And lots more. Surely, I will always recommend them days in and days out
